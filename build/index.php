               Our CTF is a <strong class="purple">three days jeopardy style</strong> contest where we have a bunch of challenges hosted across multiple Cloud providers across multiple categories of difficulty.<br><br>

               You can register as teams or go solo, use hints or stay away from them, in the end it will be all for glory or nothing. Plus the prizes. Did we not mention the prizes? :D<br><br>

               See you on the other side!</p>

                                            <p class="services__item__text">Imagine you've protected your production Google Cloud environment from compromised credentials, using MFA and a hardware security key. However, you find that your GCP environment has been breached through hijacking of OAuth session tokens cached by gcloud access. Tokens were exfiltrated and used to invoke API calls from another host. The tokens were refreshed by the attacker and did not require MFA. Detecting the breach via Strackdriver was confusing, slowing incident response. And revoking the active OAuth sessions required finding OAuth tokens from logs and using a REST API call, causing further delays in remediation.<br><br>

                                             This talk will demonstrate a compromised credential attack in Google Cloud Platform by:<br><br>
                                             - hijacking cached OAuth tokens stored on a GCP administrator's client machine and<br>
                                             - reusing existing gcloud CLI sessions to gain access to multiple GCP environments<br>
                                             - showing that MFA does not apply to OAuth token refreshes for cached credentials (only the initial login)<br><br>

                                             The POC takes advantage of several issues with GCP IAM design or configuration:
                                             OAuth tokens are cached and unencrypted, allowing easy access once the client endpoint has been exploited.<br><br>
                                             - Tokens can have long or no expiration, allowing potentially long time windows for compromise.<br>
                                             - The attacker can easily refresh tokens, allowing persistence.<br>
                                             - Token refresh does not require MFA making it easy to maintain persistence, creating a false sense of security when MFA is enabled.<br>
                                             - Authentication and Access policies are defined in different admin areas, are confusing, and easily misconfigured.<br>
                                             - Configuring Stackdriver Logging is confusing, leading to slow or ineffective incident response.<br>
                                             - OAuth tokens cannot be revoked easily making remediation difficult.<br><br>

                                             We will discuss various approaches and challenges to defending:<br><br>
                                             1. Prevention<br><br>
                                             - MFA is not required to refresh the OAuth token<br>
                                             - Google cloud session timeout (GSuite Admin)<br>
                                             - IP whitelisting (using VPC Service Controls and Access Context Manager)<br>
                                             - Explicit client-side revokes (manual)<br>
                                             2. Detection <br><br>
                                             - Stackdriver logging data access events must be enabled for all services or else the abuse of OAuth tokens will not be logged and remediation will not be possible.<br>
                                             - Periodic audit checks on the logs or IAM configurations can be somewhat useful for compliance, but are not real-time so are of limited use for detection.<br>
                                             3. Remediation<br><br>
                                             - OAuth tokens can be revoked, but there are caveats:<br>
                                                + ""gcloud auth revoke"" only works on the compromised user's endpoint and requires the user account in order to look up the locally cached OAuth token. This will fail if the attacker deletes the gcloud credential cache.<br>
                                                + A REST API revoke call works and requires the OAuth token, so reliable logging and event parsing must be implemented to ensure tokens can be extracted quickly for IR.<br>
                                             - Deletion of user accounts has a huge impact.<br>
                                             - Browser sessions can be revoked but does not apply to Google Cloud sessions.</p>

                                            <p class="services__item__text">Security teams in the cloud are faced with an overwhelming amount of information to process in order to keep their environments secure. Keeping up with everything manually is a difficult, never-ending task where failure can have high consequences. Permissions management can be a time-consuming task, and as a security engineer, you’d often ask your self “how should have access to what?” , “who have access it in the past?” and “Is it OK to remediate those excessive permissions or would it cause a downtime?“.<br><br>
                                            In this talk, we will demonstrate a method to automatically secure a live AWS IAM environment to a specific, less-permissive role that best fits the access pattern using the open-source tool: https://github.com/bridgecrewio/AirIAM/ . At the end of the talk, we will have a result in Terraform code with a much smaller attack surface and reduced risk.</p>

                                            <p class="services__item__text">Traditional ransomware has become a popular tool for cybercriminals to make their buck and has cost a variety of industries hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in recent years. As trends change and corporations move from traditional data centers to cloud environments like AWS, GCP, and Azure, adversaries are adapting their techniques to match the new climate. Because of this, attackers abusing cloud APIs rather than host/network-based commands are becoming more prevalent. This talk explores the services most likely to be targeted by ransomware in AWS cloud, techniques that attackers may use, and preventative/detective measures to assist the blue team.</p>

                                            <p class="services__item__text">If you are a customer of AWS, Azure, or GCP, you may have deployed your own bastion hosts to provide RDP or SSH access to your virtual machines. While bastions help to protect your infrastructure, there are challenges that come along with them, such as managing the identities, obtaining logs, and preventing SSH multiplexing attacks.<br><br>
                                             In this talk, we will briefly review bastion hosts and some of their shortcomings, as well as the SSH multiplexing attack. The SSH multiplexing attack uses a feature of SSH to pivot from a compromised laptop to your bastion hosts. From there, the attacker could use this feature to compromise other users and gain access to your virtual machines hosted in the cloud.<br><br>
                                             Finally, we’ll show you services that provide access to your virtual machines in all three major cloud providers that eliminate the need for bastion hosts. Some providers have more than one alternative. However, this presentation will not present all of the alternatives. It is focused on the services that generally take the following approach:<br><br>
                                             Users authenticate to the access service with their Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials for the cloud provider.<br>
                                             Once authenticated, the cloud service creates an encrypted tunnel with port forwarding, which runs SSH or RDP for the user.<br><br>
                                             The benefits of this approach include:<br>
                                             Public IP addresses are not required in order to access the virtual machines.<br>
                                             It eliminates the possibility of compromising an entire organization with SSH multiplexing attacks.<br>
                                             In some cases, disabling a user’s IAM credentials also removes SSH or RDP access.<br>
                                             Cloud audit logs will capture metadata for RDP or SSH sessions, and in some cases, full session logs are easy to collect through the provider’s service.<br>
                                             We’ll cover Session Manager in AWS, OS Login and Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) in GCP, and the Bastion Service in Azure. You’ll see how the services work, how they help with identity management, and where to find the SSH sessions in logs.<br>
                                             If you are migrating to any of these platforms, this could save you from having to go through the pain of deploying your own solutions!</p>

However, it also brings its own set of challenges and security issues which may lead to novel or unexpected attack scenarios. This talk aims to go over various areas of Kubernetes security and ways that Kubernetes features could be leveraged by an attacker. It will review the core architecture and functionality of Kubernetes from a security perspective, and cover most of the common Kubernetes security features, including Pod Security Policies, Network Policies, and RBAC.<br><br>
                                            These discussions will be underlined by examples of attack paths that have been found in real-world environments, discussing how it was possible to exploit misconfigurations to escalate privileges with the end goal of compromising the cluster and breaking out into the broader environment.</p>

                                            <p class="services__item__text">AWS is a very complex and ever-changing platform, which presents a challenge to defenders and an opportunity for attackers. Among some of the most complex and powerful features of AWS is its IAM functionality, which allows for very granular control but is famously complex to learn and set up.<br><br>
                                             One the features of access control in AWS is that AWS accounts are a self-contained unit of processing, storage and access control. Given how AWS itself recommends segregation across accounts as a best practice, and the fact that many SaaS vendors request access to their customers' accounts in order to perform their services, this presents a challenge.<br><br>
                                             In this talk we will present in detail the policy-fu needed in order to securely allow principals from one account to perform actions on another, both inside different accounts in an organization but especially from the perspective of a SaaS provider that needs to access hundreds or thousands of customer accounts. Existing research on defenses and possible attacks will be presented and demonstrated to illustrate the concepts.<br><br>
                                          SaaS vendors like ""single pane of glass"" offerings, multi-cloud solutions and CSPM offerings are huge concentrators of risk since they have access to potentially thousands of customer AWS accounts. By exploring how this access can be uniquely secured due to capabilities only AWS provides and how vendors can fail at this we hope to allow attendees to better understand the risks of using these services, and also help service providers mitigate them.</p>

                                             Cloud instance forensic acquisition presents certain challenges to forensics teams. Traditional forensic methods usually are not effective in the cloud. Access and networks are designed differently than in an on-premise Data Center. Forward thinking strategies need to be implemented so that Incident Response Cyber teams can effectively use forensically sound methods to examine artifacts on hosts. <br><br>
                                              
                                             My talk is about how to prepare your organization for forensic acquisitions in a cloud infrastructure. I will quickly cover how to prepare a fleet of systems for memory and physical disk forensics. The targets are AWS EC2 instances but could be applied to any other cloud providers host provisioning infrastructure. I will focus on the process and infrastructure required to do this level of inspection. By the end you will be able to apply these strategies to activities such as Threat Hunting. <br><br>
                                              
                                             Many organizations struggle with implementing Threat Hunting programs with orchestration in mind to capture memory and disk level forensics. How does a Cyber team respond to an alert they receive from a cloud host? How can they quickly collect artifacts for further forensic inspection?  Last, how can you best secure the forensics infrastructure from where you launch the orchestrated forensic examiner systems?<br><br>
                                              
                                             The first part of my talk will describe the infrastructure required to be in the place to support forensic orchestration. I will outline a strategy: servers, tools, storage, and protective measures to ensure that forensic activities are conducted behind a cloud of secrecy. Maintaining stealth mode is critically important to enabling the forensic team to do their job while the business is not impacted by the investigative activities. <br><br>
                                              
                                             In the second part, we will examine the pipeline process to implement solutions in EC2 instances with pre-configured memory and acquisition tools ready to be tapped into by the forensic team. I will discuss some of the challenges encountered when conducting forensics with the different AWS hypervisor solutions. <br><br>

                                             As a result, testing each design of the Linux instances with your forensics tools is an important part of the process. Do not expect the forensic tools to work seamlessly when the architecture teams switch fundamental infrastructure designs. Each phase of the AMI delivery pipeline needs to be tested and verified that the Cyber team can continue to perform their investigations without running into challenges during a real incident. Do not wait until forensics is really needed to only find out that the tools designed did not perform their job.<br>

                                             The cloud brings a broad range of benefits from a security perspective, including network isolation by default, strong identity controls and unprecedented visibility. It does, however, bring many changes and unique challenges of its own when compared to an on-premise estate, with modern cloud environments make heavy use of containerisation, serverless functions and other new paradigms. As such, many of the data sources used for threat hunting and attack detection in traditional environments are no longer available. In addition, most attacks consist of abusing legitimate functionality, making it challenging at times to differentiate the malicious from the benign.<br><br>

                                             Based on ﬁrst-hand experience attacking and defending large enterprises, this talk will compare and contrast the benefits and challenges of attack detection in the cloud against on-premise detection, and highlight some of the key advantages, common pitfalls and key data sources. It will also offer advice and guidance on developing your own cloud attack detection capabilities in house.<br><br>

                                             Lastly, it will present Leonidas - a cloud native toolchain that allows users to easily define, simulate and detect new attack vectors and techniques against cloud environments, all tied back to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This will include deploying and using Leonidas, constructing and executing an attack path end-to-end, and how to implement your own test cases. It'll also cover Leonidas into your detection stack to track improvement over time and support learning and skills development within your team.

                                          As the number of production assets and workloads transition to cloud, it is more important than ever to be able to understand the ""goings-on"" of these type of environments.  Unfortunately, many organizations still have little visibility into cloud infrastructure.  Vendor-specific solutions can be cost-prohibitive, and don't always offer a complete solution for security monitoring.  In this session, we'll discuss how we can better defend cloud environments by leveraging Security Onion, a completely free and open source platform for intrusion detection, enterprise security monitoring, and log management.  By using Security Onion, we can pierce the veil of the cloud, and gain better visibility to facilitate threat detection, identify application misconfigurations, and assist with compliance-related efforts.  Attendees should walk away with a firm grasp of the platform, understanding how they can utilize Security Onion to improve their organization's security posture, and make their adversaries cry.<br><br>

                                         <p class="services__item__text">Organizational data is rapidly moving to the cloud, but it's not always intentional. The shift from on-premise data storage to the cloud constitutes a significant challenge and risk to the modern enterprise. The use of cloud file storage applications is on the rise for both consumer and business systems, which results in interesting data and metadata siting on endpoints. In this talk, we'll examine the large footprints of popular cloud file storage applications such as OneDrive and Box - learning what information can be enumerated from each cloud file storage solution. In some scenarios, data can be carved out from cache, restoring sensitive documents no longer on an endpoint.<br><br>

                                             We'll cover the current state of infrastructure security in the open source registries.<br><br>
                                             From there we will continue to discuss best practices for writing, testing, and maintaining infrastructure at scale, keeping the infrastructure code secured using open source scanners.<br><br>
                                             We will cover infrastructure security use cases like encryption, public-facing data entities and plain text secrets, And will show how to find those using policy as code.</p>

Major focus is on remediations for misconfigurations which could make resources(ec2-ami,snapshots, s3, redshift, rds..) publicly exposed, making it low lift for attackers to get foothold or data exfiltration. The framework is easily customizable, giving the ability to add new modules for AWS resources you want to watch for/automatically fix, when they become non compliant. <br><br>

                                             Demo and Q&A (10 minutes): We will open source and demo the Remediation Framework by making few AWS resources publicly exposed and letting the remediation framework fix it automatically.<br><br></p>
